                        <div class="text"> At Haris Benzz, our unparalleled marketing strategies and networking capabilities result in more sales and higher sale prices. We are recognized consistently as the #1 agent in the area annually by the Wall Street Journal/Real Trends list of top agents by sales volume, as well as by the Hollywood Reporter and Variety magazine 2015-2019. Our expertise is unrivaled, as we sell more than 100 properties per year in Los Angeles. We don’t just plug your home into a “system” like the many behemoth brokerages, we take a personal and specific approach to each home – that is what makes the difference. We consult and advise our clients from the very beginning, to determine the best mechanisms and strategies to sell the home, and at the highest price. Appearance matters, and we are experts in creating and managing the presentation of your home, understanding that success rests in the details, and that nothing is more important than hard work, ambition, and extreme dedication.  </div>
